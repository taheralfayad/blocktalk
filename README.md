Ensure that you have the [following repo also cloned](https://github.com/taheralfayad/blocktalk_backend) 

Go to the Makefile and put your machine's IP Address in the IP_ADDRESS variable. This is so that the mobile application knows how to communicate with your backend.

To run the app, use `make run`. This will run the flutter application with the URL of the backend.
